          My real name is <strong>Ammar Sufyan</strong>. I'm currently an
          Informatics Engineering student at UIN Jakarta. <br />I like to code
          on some side project on my free time. I'm interested in machine
          learning, data science and software engineering. You can find me on
          Github or Linkedin.

        <p style="text-align: center">
          I like to travel and learn about cultures around the world. I'm also
          interested in photography and graphic design. I like to read books,
          listen to music and play video games. I also like to learn new things
          and travel around the world. When I'm not working, I like to spend
          time with my friends and family.

        <p style="text-align: center">
          I think it's important to get out of your comfort zone and try new things as often as possible. 
          The more you try, the more likely it is that you'll find something that works for you. 
          But, I also think it's important to take some time to yourself every day. You can't do everything at once!
